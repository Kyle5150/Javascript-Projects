# Overview

I am trying to understand how Node.js works, and how I can use my knowledge of Javascript to produce something using Node.js.

I have built my first web app using Node.js. It is nothing special, just a working product is all I was going for. I was also able to complete a working to-do list app to improve my skills with Javascript, CSS, and HTML.

# Development Environment

- JavaScript
- Node.js
- HTML
- CSS

# Useful Websites/Videos

- [Creating To-do List App](https://youtu.be/MkESyVB4oUw)
- [Node.js Guide](https://youtu.be/ENrzD9HAZK4)

# Future Work

I would like to continue adding features to my to-do list application, and I would also like to create a purposful app using Node.js as well.

- To-do List App - keep local memory of items created
- To-do List App - check box that crosses off items from your list, but you can still see them in a seperate list
- Node.js - build a meaningful app that I can have someone else find and use
